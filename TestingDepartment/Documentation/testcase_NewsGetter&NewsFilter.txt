For the NewsGetter we will test if it receives  all the information that we have had searched:
-receive nothing 
*possible errors:maybe because it receives only spaces and no words
-receive symbols between letters
*possible errors: maybe because it can't read some of the symbols
-receive a very long word
*possible errors: maybe it reads a part of the word(maybe because it truncate the word and search for the part that makes sense; it should raise an error message who will say that the limit for characters has been reached)
-receive a link
*possible errors: maybe the link is broken and it doesn't work
For the NewsFilter we will test if it receives from the NewsGetter duplicate articles:
-can't find any articles
*possible errors:maybe the article has other name
-3 or more articles match
*possible errors:maybe it doesn't see that the articles match
-can't filter article by age (for parent control)
*possible errors:maybe because it doesn't have an age specification
